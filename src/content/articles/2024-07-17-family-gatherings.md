I'm usually not a fan of big family gatherings. You know the type, every aunt and their neighbour is invited to some tiny town half-way across the country and then you sit there trying to small talk about the most inane topics. Usually it's some kid is getting christened or an uncle turns 80 years old. Dunno.

I don't mind the extended family, cousins, uncles and whatnot. They're alright people, but I'm not really close with them either and we share nothing in common apart from being distantly related.

Today we met up with my cousin and his family. I haven't seen them in a decade and to my surprise, it was alright. The kids are more grown up and we could actually chat. The kids also brought their partners who seemed like decent fellows so that's nice.

Driving for four hours to hang out and grill a bit isn't still fun and I'm absolutely knackered, but expectations were at least exceeded.
