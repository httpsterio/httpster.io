If you don't want to read all the stuff leading up to the install instructions, you should skip to [Installing Umami](#installing-umami).


## Intro
Web analytics can be rather useful. They help you form an understanding of your users, how many there are and where they come from, which can help you plan and optimize your content, if you so desire.

I don't really care about that myself, but I have to admit that it feels good to see the viewcounters go up. _I am vain, I know_.

## The good and the bad
I think I can guess what you're thinking.

_"Web analytics. Eughhh! I don't want to add an ugly-ass cookie banner and sell my user's data to $BIG CORP Ltd."_.

This would be necessary, if you'd use something like Hotjar, Heap, or _\*shudder\*_ Google Analytics. Corporations offer you these tools for your convenience at either a hefty fee or at the cost of your users' data. Sometimes both.

Fear not, though! If you don't collect and store identifiable information on your users, you don't need to add those pesky cookies and banners that they go with. Lately, these types of analytics services have started to pop up. The downside with these, is the fact that you get less information on your users, but your users will likely consider that a plus. I do at least.

Plausible[^1] and Fathom[^2] are some really solid options, if you don't mind spending some dough. GoatCounter[^3] and Umami[^4] are great, if you can only spend a little bit or are looking for a generous free tier. I used GoatCounter for a while and really enjoyed it, but in the end I moved to Umami for reasons I'll explain a bit later!

If you want to tell your users to go fuck themselves, you could also pay for something like Hotjar or Fullstory or just use Google Analytics. But, that'd be kinda disrespectful I think? Yeah, don't do that.
