Computers have always been a big part of my life. On most days, most of the time I am awake, I spend it on a computer. My work, hobbies, education and entertainment habits have always been this way. I was never a programmer wunderkind, but computers have enabled so much in my life that I can only be glad of the opportunity to grow up with them as an integral part of my life.

In this post, I'll try to chronicle how they've influenced me over the years.

## In the '90s

In the mid '90s, we had two IBM office PCs. They were both running Windows 95 and later one of them was upgraded to Windows 98. They cost roughly 10,000 Danish krones, with inflation that's about 2,200€ each. 

My parents ran a textile importing business in Denmark and they were both quite technical-minded. They used the PCs mainly to keep inventory and run the books. The PCs were an investment for them. I didn't really find their uses that inspiring, I would much rather scribble with MS Paint or play some video games on the computer. Torin's Passage, Battle Beasts, The Lost Brain of Dr. Brain and other crappy CD-i type point and clicks were mostly what we had. And Solitaire of course.

One day, my best friend's big brother came over for a visit. He had gotten his hands on some proper games that he installed for us. __Diablo I__, __Heroes of Might and Magic II__ and __Starcraft__. Up until that point, I had mostly just played Super Mario 64 on our Nintendo 64 and whatever console games my friends had, but this was my first venture into PC gaming. Those three PC games are still peak cozyness—___hygge___ _as we say in Danish_—for me. Decard Cain, Alamar and Jim Raynor were my first English tutors and before the age of 9, I was pretty much fluent in my third language.

## The Noughties

After my parents split in 2001 and we moved to Finland, we only had the crappier PC running Windows 95 and no games. In my deepest and darkest hours, I started playing around with the other applications found on the computer. I'm not sure how many paintings, short stories and animations I made in MS Paint, Word and Powerpoint, but there was a lot of them. Luckily, they're lost to the sands of time as most of those wouldn't fly in this day and age.

In 2004 we went to visit my cousin in Denmark and as he was about to buy a new PC for himself, he sold his older one to my parents. This was also the same summer I managed to convince my parents to get us an ADSL connection. I went from fooling around in Windows 95 to a machine with XP, 1 gigabyte of RAM, 128mb of video memory and a 0.5mb internet connection. Talk about progress! I finally got to play those old and good Blizzard games on top of a few new ones as well. Riven, Sudeki, Far Cry and Warcraft 3 on top of a ton of smaller freebie games like Liero, Soldat, Little Fighter 2 and Dim. Life was pretty good!

The PC was definitely an upgrade but it also wasn't definitely top of the line, Oblivion for example ran as fast as a slideshow and I had to mod it with Oldblivion which rendered most textures as 2D and it resembled Doom more than itself.

## Websites ahead!

Now we're in around the years 2006 or so, the point when I started to get into creating websites. The Finnish online circles at the time were quite small and smaller websites had started to pop up. Some friends of my friends had their own little personal spaces online where they shared game cheat codes, links to free games, warezing tips and other random info and I thought that was maybe the coolest thing ever. 

I wanted to do the same. So, I learned how to make my own websites.

My first website was created a couple of years earlier, but I was completely hand held and didn't have any access after the one time when we uploaded a couple of files to the server. It was during a summer course where I had the opportunity to create a comic and then upload it to my very own website, hosted on the municipal's webserver. Built proudly with an early 2000s' era Microsoft Frontpage and with a huge scanned photo of Son Goku from Dragonball giving the finger, my first website was glorious.

This time around I was actually going to make something myself I could control, update and actually make mine. For a while, I was playing around with Freewebs, they had a pretty cool WYSIWYG editor with templates and you could even embed a music player that played midi music from various games. I had some tracks from Warcraft II in the background. But in the end, I wanted to learn HTML and host it on an actual server.

Anglefire and Geocities were all the rage as were the .tk domains that you could get for free. So, after a while of playing around with notepad, WinSCP and some online tutorials, my hand-made website was online! I had settled on Geocities and gave up using any fancy-smancy domains as it but some ugly ad bars on the top of the site.

With the help of my friend, we made a ___cool___ flame wallpaper and some hue-shifted alternate versions of it as well. The only thing missing was obviously an advert for the newly opened website!
