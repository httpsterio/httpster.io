Computers have always been a big part of my life. On most days, most of the time I am awake, I spend it on a computer. My work, hobbies, education and entertainment habits have always been this way. I was never a programmer wunderkind, but computers have enabled so much in my life that I can only be glad of the opportunity to grow up with them as an integral part of my life.

In this post, I'll try to chronicle at least a part of my journey.

## In the '90s

In the mid '90s, we had two IBM office PCs. They were both running Windows 95 and later one of them was upgraded to Windows 98. They cost roughly 10,000 Danish krones, with inflation that's about 2,200€ each. 

My parents ran a textile importing business in Denmark and they were both quite technical-minded. They used the PCs mainly to keep inventory and run the books. The PCs were an investment for them. I didn't really find their uses that inspiring, I would much rather scribble with MS Paint or play some video games on the computer. Torin's Passage, Battle Beasts, The Lost Brain of Dr. Brain and other crappy CD-i type point and clicks were mostly what we had. And Solitaire of course.

One day, my best friend's big brother came over for a visit. He had gotten his hands on some proper games that he installed for us. __Diablo I__, __Heroes of Might and Magic II__ and __Starcraft__. Up until that point, I had mostly just played Super Mario 64 on our Nintendo 64 and whatever console games my friends had, but this was my first venture into PC gaming. Those three PC games are still peak cozyness—___hygge___ _as we say in Danish_—for me. Decard Cain, Alamar and Jim Raynor were my first English tutors and before the age of 9, I was pretty much fluent in my third language.

## The Noughties

After my parents split in 2001 and we moved to Finland, we only had the crappier PC running Windows 95 and no games. In my deepest and darkest hours, I started playing around with the other applications found on the computer. I'm not sure how many paintings, short stories and animations I made in MS Paint, Word and Powerpoint, but there was a lot of them. Luckily, they're lost to the sands of time as most of those wouldn't fly in this day and age. But I kept myself entertained with whatever silly little applications our machines had installed and it was all great fun.

In 2004 we went to visit my cousin in Denmark and as he was about to buy a new PC for himself, he sold his older one to my parents. This was also the same summer I managed to convince my parents to get us an ADSL connection. I went from fooling around in Windows 95 to a machine with XP, 1 gigabyte of RAM, 128mb of video memory and a 0.5mb internet connection. Talk about progress! I finally got to play those old and good Blizzard games on top of a few new ones as well. Riven, Sudeki, Far Cry and Warcraft 3 on top of a ton of smaller freebie games like Liero, Soldat, Little Fighter 2 and Dim. Life was pretty good!

The PC was definitely an upgrade but it also wasn't definitely top of the line, Oblivion for example ran as fast as a slideshow and I had to mod it with Oldblivion which rendered most textures as 2D and it resembled Doom more than itself.

## from websites...

Now we're in around the years 2006 or so, the point when I started to get into creating websites. The Finnish online circles at the time were quite small and smaller websites had started to pop up. Some friends of my friends had their own little personal spaces online where they shared game cheat codes, links to free games, warezing tips and other random info and I thought that was maybe the coolest thing ever. 

I wanted to do the same. So, I learned how to make my own websites.

My first website was created a couple of years earlier, but I was completely hand held and didn't have any access after the one time when we uploaded a couple of files to the server. It was during a summer course where I had the opportunity to create a comic and then upload it to my very own website, hosted on the municipal's webserver. Built proudly with an early 2000s' era Microsoft Frontpage and with a huge scanned photo of Son Goku from Dragonball giving the finger, my first website was glorious.

This time around I was actually going to make something myself I could control, update and actually make mine. For a while, I was playing around with Freewebs, they had a pretty cool WYSIWYG editor with templates and you could even embed a music player that played midi music from various games. I had some tracks from Warcraft II in the background. But in the end, I wanted to learn HTML and host it on an actual server.

Anglefire and Geocities were all the rage as were the .tk domains that you could get for free. So, after a while of playing around with notepad, WinSCP and some online tutorials, my hand-made website was online! I had settled on Geocities and gave up using any fancy-smancy domains as it but some ugly ad bars on the top of the site.

With the help of my friend, we made a ___cool___ flame wallpaper and some hue-shifted alternate versions of it as well. The only thing missing was obviously an advert for the newly opened website!

The video is actually featuring one of the first tracks I made with Sony Acid and a bunch of free loops. I've lost the first handful of tracks shown in the Beta Records screenshot. I've since backed up and kept a copy of every track and project I've made after I moved to FL Studio, but those Sony Acid tracks are sadly lost to time.

Anyways, nälkä kasvaa syödessä as we say in Finland! I was ravenous. I kept making new sites, redid my own site at least a half a dozen times in the following years, sites for friends and gaming guilds and a plethora of other projects and groups.

## ...to music blogs!

At some point around 2008 I got into music blogs. My whole journey into that world and what came of it is worth its' own writeup of its own. After spending a considerable amount of time on sites like Dani Deahl's DSQUAREd, Trashbag Kids, Too Many Sebastians, Dödselectro, Vacay Vitamins, Missintoof, Datasapiens and a slew of other sites, I wanted in the scene.

I did what all the other cool kids did and talked my way into using our high school's server and setup Wordpress. I managed to snag a fun domain and off we went! The site did pretty well after a slow start and in the end, I started to average over 10k daily views. I moved servers a couple of times as I started to encounter slowdowns and at some point I started hacking at the Wordpress theme code to remove database queries from things I deemed unnecessary. 
_What is caching btw?_
Plugins, theme customizations, responsive web design, I had to learn a whole bunch of things! Throw in some domain and custom email management, mySQL databases, CDN for file storage etc.

I've since grown and outgrown Wordpress. These days I prefer static site generators, but over the years I've definitely had to work with the odd Wordpres site here and there. I didn't know it back then, but I would definitely attribute my career in tech as having being largely influenced by how I drifted into music blogging and all of the skills I ended up teaching myself.


## Let's LAN!

If we go back to 2006, it's also around the time I finally got my very own computer. My two best buddies had already had a PC of their own so the only thing left to do is have a LAN party, right?

I'm of the opinion that LAN partying might be the most fun you can have with or without your pants. So much so, that everytime someone in our clique had an empty house or an excuse to evict the 'rents, we'd have a teeny tiny LAN party going.

Usually we'd play Starcraft, Unreal and Trackmania with Liero Xtreme and Soldat deserving some respectful mentions as well. Back then, most games that had any type of multiplayer could also locally host a server. I wish games still had that. 

Our second LAN party was when I downloaded _(read, pirated from Rapidshare, RIP)_ FL Studio for the first time and really got into music making. We'd play around and do dumb stuff, trying to break FL Studio and that's how the first tracks were born. Sepe Susi and the Lunatic Disco Police, truly an autre piece of art.

_Side note: I did eventually buy a license for FL Studio. Right after I came into some actual real money after graduating high school._

We had so much fun that other people in our friend group wanted in on the action. Usually it was just the three of us and those were the most fun parties in my opinion, but occasionally we'd have other participants as well. All fine and dandy, fun is meant to be shared around.

We kept these parties going through elementary school right up until high school graduation. Even after going to different high schools, we couldn't be stopped! Moving cross the country for university was what finally forced our hand and now when we meet, it's usually without our respective computers.

A couple of years later, I started to partake in larger LAN parties as well. Assembly was the big one and occasionally I also went to The Group's parties. I was helping out my rhythm gaming friends and running the game stands and later running Microsoft's booth, but I always left plenty of time to just hang out with my buddies from all over Finland.
