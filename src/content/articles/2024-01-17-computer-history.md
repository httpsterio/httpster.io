Computers have always been a big part of my life. On most days, most of the time I am awake, I spend it on a computer. My work, hobbies, education and entertainment habits have always been this way.

## In the '90s

In the mid '90s, we had two IBM office PCs. They were both running Windows 95 and later one of them was upgraded to Windows 98. They cost roughly 10,000 Danish krones, with inflation that's about 2,200€ each. 

My parents ran a textile importing business in Denmark and they were both quite technical-minded. They used the PCs mainly to keep inventory and run the books. The PCs were an investment for them. I didn't really find their uses that inspiring, I would much rather scribble with MS Paint or play some video games on the computer. Torin's Passage, The Lost Brain of Dr. Brain and other crappy CD-i type point and clicks were mostly what we had. And Solitaire of course.

One day, my best friend's big brother came over for a visit. He had gotten his hands on some proper games that he installed for us. __Diablo I__, __Heroes of Might and Magic II__ and __Starcraft__. Up until that point, I had mostly just played Super Mario 64 on our Nintendo 64 and whatever console games my friends had, but this was my first venture into PC gaming. Those three PC games are still peak cozyness—___hygge___ _as we say in Danish_—for me. Decard Cain, Alamar and Jim Raynor were my first English tutors and before the age of 9, I was pretty much fluent in my third language.

## The Noughties

After my parents split in 2001 and we moved to Finland, we only had the crappier PC running Windows 95 and no games. In my deepest and darkest hours, I started playing around with the other applications found on the computer
