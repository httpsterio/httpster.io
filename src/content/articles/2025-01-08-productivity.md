I set out to write a simple “New Year, new me” type of blog post. Bish bash bosh, done and dusted, right? Nope!

I fell for the productivity illusion. I decided to do a teeny-tiny bit of housekeeping on the website—which quickly spiraled into fixing my RSS feeds and releasing not just one, but three separate feeds (Atom, RSS, and JSON). A touch of CSS here, some Eleventy filters there.

Next thing I know, it’s 10 a.m., and I haven’t written a single word. It felt like I had gotten a lot done but really, I didn't achieve any of what I actually needed to do.

Oh well. C’est la vie with ADHD.
