I set out to write a simple _“New Year, new me”_ type of blog post. Bish bash bosh, done and dusted, right? Nope!

After booting up VS Code, I remembered seeing on Robb's [Lens](https://lens.rknight.me) website that my RSS feed was missing the proper meta tag. While looking up how to correctly set it up I fell into the trap.

I can reveal now that I didn't write that blog post, not a single word. I did however fix my RSS and added two additional feeds that are fully validated, so now you can subscribe to my nonexistant content with Atom, RSS and JSON feeds :D. I also created a new Eleventy filter for my website and did some CSS tidying as I found some broken behavior with images.

Ironically, this post was written on my phone at 10 a.m. after shutting off my desktop PC and giving up for the night _(day, morning w/e, sleep patterns are a scam by Big Sleep™)_.

The thing about this type of ___"productivity"___ is that it's not very productive at all. I didn't accomplish the task I set out to do. I did get a lot of things done, but I didn't work on anything I actually needed to do. I didn't even really have the opportunity to make a choice at any point, I kinda just slipped into gear of working on unrelated semi-adjacent issues. This is pretty common with ADHD and really quite annoying.

I don't like not having the option to choose, I don't want to get swept away because I can't decide what to focus on.

If this resonated with you or you have suggestions on what I could try, please feel free to shoot me a message!
