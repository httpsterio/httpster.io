## Time for a site refresh

After three and a half years exactly, I think it was time to rewrite my site. There were multiple reasons for this.

The previous version of this site had been based on a fork of Mike Riethmuller's [Supermaya](https://github.com/MadeByMike/supermaya), which is an Eleventy starter project. Eleventy was still pretty new at the time and there weren't a ton of starter projects available. Supermaya kinda hit the sweet spot for me, being just enough fleshed out to get me going, but at the same it didn't get too much in the way.
