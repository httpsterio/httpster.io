You know what's funny? When I got married two years ago, I had a lovely old time. Me and the wife put the wedding together mostly entirely by ourselves.

We did get a bit of help from my family, mainly with setting up the venue, running the kitchen _(making coffee in other words)_ and cleaning up the venue the following day.

It was very stress-free and simple. We had no expectations for our family, they kinda just helped with whatever they felt like. There wasn't a ton to do.

So you can guess my surprise when being the bestman for my brother turns out to be quite the opposite of easy or relaxing. There's a lot more coordination and planning to be done, I have more tasks than I had at my own wedding. I still haven't written the speech and it's less than a week away!

It kinda makes sense why this is stressing me out. I don't have a clear picture of the upcoming wedding as it's not my own. I don't know what to expect and therefore I can't plan anything ahead, I don't know what's to be expected as I can't read anyone's mind.

My wife also said something very similar to me just today, so I guess I'm not alone with the feeling. Luckily, in less than a weeks time it's over and I can finally relax. But, before that I do have a ton of things to do.
