Stranded in Jyväskylä is a point-and-click set in the city of Jyväskylä, Finland.

We made this during the 2015 Global Game Jam and I'll be the first to admit that it was a disaster.

There's roughly five minutes of gameplay in total and it's not very engaging. I only worked on the music so I can't really say anything other than we didn't really know what kinda game we were doing and all of the time just went into... something?

The game is up on Github if you're so inclined. I wouldn't be.
