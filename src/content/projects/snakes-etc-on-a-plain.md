Snakes etc. On A Plain is the second game jam game I've been a part of building and it's also possibly one of the most fun ones!

The game is a local co-op platformer where each player controls an animal character while being able to swap which animal the other player is playing. Each animal has a different movement mechanic and all of them are required to clear different parts of the levels.

The game is fun, fast paced and chaotic.

It's built with Python 2.7, pyglet 1.2 and py2exe. I also set up a Github action that can build a Windows executable on each tagged release. Mac and Linux builds should be fairly straightforward to build, I included some of the Python libraries in the Git repo so you can use pip to install them.
