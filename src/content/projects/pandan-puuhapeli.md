Pandan Puuhapeli (Panda's activity game) was the second year group project I did during my studies at the University of applied sciences.

The game's audience is roughly first graders (7 ish years of age) and it consists of a series of educational mini games. It's made with Flash and ActionScript 2.

For a long time after finishing the project, I wasn't really happy with the end result. The team worked quite well together, but we struggled to come up with any good ideas to go on. The idea of an educational game for kids was kinda a safe option that nobody really felt that passionate about.

12 years later—_has it really been that long?_—, I'm actually quite proud of it. It's a solid game that actually looks and sounds better than a lot of actually publicly funded edutainment games made around that time. I could definitely see the game being played on some iPad in a dentist's waiting room.

The game is entirely in Finnish, I don't recommend it unless you're somewhat fluent in the language. It also needs [Newgrounds' flash emulator](https://www.newgrounds.com/flash/player) or something similar, Ruffle.rs doesn't emulate it properly.
