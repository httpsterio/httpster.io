We made Student Life Simulator during my first game jam ever, way back in 2013.

I didn't know anybody there and had next to zero gamedev experience, but I'd already worked with music and audio for a few years so I got teamed up with some people needing a sound and game designer.

After some brainstorming and sketching the first evening, we had a solid idea locked in and started working. The end result was chaotic. In a good way.

The goal of Student Life Simulator is to not die. Simple enough, just keep your heart rate under 200 and you're golden.

Oh and don't forget to cook food, take out the trash, do the dishes, fill out benefit applications, answer the door and keep yourself intoxicated enough to not hate life. Failing at any of these tasks will raise your heart rate faster than eating a metric ton of salmiakki will.

In short, you have to play six simultaneous minigames for as long as possible. It's quite fun! The code and release version is up on GitHub!
