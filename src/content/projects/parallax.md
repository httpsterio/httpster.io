During my studies at the university of applied sciences, I completed an elective minor in video game production worth 19 ECTS study credits or roughly 500 hours. A majority of the time was spent working as teams producing a game.

Our team was called Paradogs and the game is called Parallax. The Paradogs team consisted of two programmers, a graphics artist, a game designer and myself. I was in charge of project management, communications, sound design and music.

We had a website, marketing material and some cool email addresses like sami@parado.gs

Parallax is a platformer game with a creatively stylized main character _(a white box)_ that you have to navigate through a myriad of traps and precision requiring rooms. Although there isn't a whole ton of content, we're very proud of this little demo we made.

There's a short gameplay [video up on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X47C7yVymHM) showing a bit of the first level.

We spent the last night before ending the course building our whole presentation inside the actual game. Instead of doing a boring old PowerPoint post-mortem of the project, we had an interactive presentation/game hybrid. No sleeps were had, but it was worth it as we scored full marks with our game.

I just recently dug up the source code and lo and behold, it still compiles with Unity 4.7.2! So, I put the [code up on GitHub](https://github.com/httpsterio/Paradogs) with a Windows build as well.

If you do happen to check it out, I'd love to hear what you think of it!
