Summogon is the latest game me, Marko and Roni have worked on.

It's a dark and ominous card puzzle game that we made during last year's Ludum Dare 55. It's pretty short and can be played in less than 10 minutes, but most likely the puzzles will take a little while longer to figure out.

To date, this is _easily_ the best ranked game we've made. Out of __2194__ games, Summogon had an overall rank of __324th__, but our audio was ranked __8th__! That means in terms of audio, we were in the top __0.32%__ which is absolutely insane.

It was my first time writing any non-rhythmic music. The backing track has three different variations that loop depending on the progress in game, growing more sinister as the player gets towards the end.

I recommend playing the game to really get in the mood of the soundscape, but if you're impatient and just want to hear the music, the main track is also up on [my SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/httpsterio/summogon-theme-ld55).

Marko and Roni also made [Flicker of Lumina](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/54/flicker-of-lumina) between Summogon and Kantelemania, which is worth mentioning as it's a very good game!
