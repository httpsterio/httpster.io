I, Love, Robot was the first of many games I got to make with my old friend Marko and his university classmate Roni.

This game is all about helping robots date. You, as a system administrator, have to figure out which kind of messages each robot is partial to and zap any unseemly dad jokes or boring anecdotes about sports etc.

It's a fun little game jam game, You can play it in the browser even!
