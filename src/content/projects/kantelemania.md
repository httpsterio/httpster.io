After doing a few Ludum Dare games with the gang, we thought we'd try out Global Game Jam for a change.

Having done [[X-ED OUT]](/project/[x-ed-out]/) earlier, we wanted to do another game that gets increasingly difficult with time and that's basically a "play until you fail" type of survival game.

We thought about the theme and diversifiers for a while, and came up with a Kalevala inspired rhythm game.

The actual gameplay is very simple—hit the corresponding arrow or WASD key according to the arrows on the screen. Missing an arrow or pressing the wrong one will drop the hype meter. When the hype meter drops to zero, it's game over.
