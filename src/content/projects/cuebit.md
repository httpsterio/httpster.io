CueBit is my first solo game ever. I made it as the final project for my university programming project.

It's a simple pool game with some decent enough physics, custom sound design and retro graphics. It's not the prettiest, most featureful pool game, but it works relatively well! It's built with C# and a fork of MonoGame called Jypeli, maintained by the University of Jyväskylä.

For the graphics —_they're stunning, I know_—I built [Aseprite](https://github.com/aseprite/aseprite) from the source code and the audio was made with my trusty copy of FL Studio.

Building it for Windows in this day and age was a bit of a chore, but I got it up and running. I managed to port it to the latest .Net runtime and latest version of Jypeli. I also added some quality of life updates to the messaging system. The comments and code is mainly in Finnish so it might not be the clearest project, but I'll try to translate it, it's only about 800 LOC in total.

Anyways, feel free to grab the release from the GitHub down below and give the game a go!
