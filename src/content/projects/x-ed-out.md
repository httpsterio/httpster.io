[X-ED OUT] is the second Ludum Dare game we made with Marko and Roni. This time, my wife also joined us!

The game is quite simple. Turn around in your turret and aim at aliens. Clearing a wave of enemies lets you pick up XP from the ground, leveling up the turret. Rinse and repeat until defeat.

We had a lot of fun making it and the game was also quite well received! Out of __2420__ games, we had an overall placement of __185th__, fun was ranked __73rd__ and audio was __68th__. It was the first time our gang had broken into the top 100 in any category.

It's really a quite fun game! Shoot some aliens and try to survive, I dare you!
